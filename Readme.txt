Interpret decision trees and random forest models using feature importances

Tune model hyperparamters to improve classification accuracy

Create interactive, GUI components in Jupyter notebooks using widgets


Task 1: Introduction and Import Libraries
Introduction to the data set and the problem overview.
See a demo of the final product you will build by the end of this project.
Introduction to the Rhyme interface.
Import essential modules and helper functions from NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
Load the employee dataset using pandas
Explore the data visually by graphing various features against the target with Matplotlib.
Task 3: Encode Categorical Features
The dataset contains two categorical variables: Department and Salary.
Create dummy encoded variables for both categorical variables.
Task 4: Visualize Class Imbalance
Use Yellowbrick's Class Balance visualizer to create a frequency plot of both classes.
The presence or absence of a class balance problem will inform your sampling strategory while creating training and validation sets.
Task 5: Create Training and Validation Sets
Split the data into a 80/20 training/validation split.
Use a stratified sampling strategy
Tasks 6 & 7: Build a Decision Tree Classifier with Interactive Controls
Use the interact function to automatically create UI controls for function arguments.
Build and train a decision tree classifier with scikit-learn.
Calculate the training and validation accuracies.
Display the fitted decision tree graphically.
Task 8: Build a Random Forest Classifier with Interactive Controls
Use the interact function again to automatically create UI controls for function arguments.
To overcome the variance problem associated with decision trees, build and train a random forests classifier with scikit-learn.
Calculate the training and validation accuracies.
Display a fitted tree graphically.
Task 9: Feature Importance Plots and Evaluation Metrics
Many model forms describe the underlying impact of features relative to each other.
Decision Tree models and Random Forest in scikit-learn, feature_importances_ attribute when fitted.
Utilize this attribute to rank and plot the features.


Predict Employee Turnover with scikit-learn
